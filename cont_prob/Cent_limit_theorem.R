# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2 / 38

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 100

# Calculate 'avg', the expected outcome of 100 spins if you win $17 when the ball lands on green and you lose $1 when the ball doesn't land on green
avg <- n * (17*p_green + -1*p_not_green)

# Compute 'se', the standard error of the sum of 100 outcomes
se <- sqrt(n) * (17 - -1)*sqrt(p_green*p_not_green)

# Using the expected value 'avg' and standard error 'se', compute the probability that you win money betting on green 100 times.

#### Q2

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2 / 38

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run. Let's run the Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 times.
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "rounding")

# Create an object called `S` that replicates the sample code for `B` iterations and sums the outcomes.

S <- replicate(B, {
        sum(sample(c(17,-1), 
                   n, 
                   replace=T, 
                   prob = c(p_green,p_not_green)))
})

# Compute the average value for 'S'

mean(S)

# Calculate the standard deviation of 'S'
